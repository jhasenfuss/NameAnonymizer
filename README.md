# NameAnonymizer

## Overview
This tool is made to anonymize chat histories. The chats are stored in .txt files in the following format:
```
Brown Bear: Need help defending blue tower
Gray Wahle: On my way
Brown Bear: Thx
Green Frog: Please join ts for better communication
Brown Bear: Good idea, second
...
```
The usernames will be replaces with "PlayerXXXX":
```
Player0001: Need help defending blue tower
Player0002: On my way
Player0001: Thx
Player0003: Please join ts for better communication
Player0001: Good idea, second
...
```

And now the chat can be used e.g. as a linguistic corpus for a scientific paper.
